## Overview
This is a Java implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm. The program takes a user-inputted string and performs calculations on the bits of the string. The program will output the corresponding MD5 hash of the string.

## Instructions
To run the program:

```
make encode ARGS="<string here>"
ex. make encode ARGS="hi"
```

If the input string has spaces, make sure to add `'` around the entire string.

```
make encode ARGS="'<string with spaces here>'"
ex. make encode ARGS="'This is an example of a string with spaces'"
```

The program will print out the md5 hash of the input string.
