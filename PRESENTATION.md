# MD5 (Hash algorithm!)

## What is MD5?
MD5 is a hashing algorithm! What is a hashing algorithm? According to the Federal Agencies Guidlines Initiative, a hashing algorithm is a function that converts a data string into a numeric string output (which might look like: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e). 

### Why do we need hashing algorithms? Why are they useful?
Data is put through hash algorithms for its protection (ensures data integrity)! The idea is if someone gains access to your server, they would be unable to read the data even though the data is technically stored there. 

### But how does Hashing achieve this?
