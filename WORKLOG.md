# Work Log

## Rachel Gao

### 5/22/24

researching more on how to implement images into SSTV audio, found a few documents about different types of sstv (some easier than others)

### 5/23/24

We decided to switch our topic to coding the md5 algorithm. I looked for a few resources and websites that explained each step of md5 and also started a skeleton for the code.

### 5/24/24

We worked together to start writing the code. We finished the first step of turning the string input into binary ascii and making a print function to check the code, which works. We started working on the padding step at the end of class.

### 5/24/24
I continued working on padding the input and finished the function but binary string representation shows integers padded with 1s in front which I'm not sure is okay (probably because byte is limited to -128 to 127). Added some code to the encode too.

Figuring out if we want to stick with audio steganography, specifically SSTV (need to figure out how to do audio "processing" in java) or replicate md5 (don't need to figure out audio processing stuff, and might be more well documented?). Indecision and lack of drive for ethier. 

### 2024/05/23
Switched to replicating MD5 because we couldn't find great documentation to debugg SSTV. Found resources to help with replciating MD5, we also have a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L5EoYW-sUBFakbkqqNC-GjzaK4cZB_PYZ6wepM9pxTg/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to check that out? 

### 2024/05/24
Coded a function with Rachel to change strings into their binary equivalent for debugging. Kinda started a padding function for step 1 of md5.
