researching more on how to implement images into SSTV audio, found a few documents about different types of sstv (some easier than others)

### 5/23/24

We decided to switch our topic to coding the md5 algorithm. I looked for a few resources and websites that explained each step of md5 and also started a skeleton for the code.

Figuring out if we want to stick with audio steganography, specifically SSTV (need to figure out how to do audio "processing" in java) or replicate md5 (don't need to figure out audio processing stuff, and might be more well documented?). Indecision and lack of drive for ethier. 

### 2024/05/23
Switched to replicating MD5 because we couldn't find great documentation to debugg SSTV. Found resources to help with replciating MD5, we also have a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L5EoYW-sUBFakbkqqNC-GjzaK4cZB_PYZ6wepM9pxTg/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to check that out?
