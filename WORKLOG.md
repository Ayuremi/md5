Figuring out if we want to stick with audio steganography, specifically SSTV (need to figure out how to do audio "processing" in java) or replicate md5 (don't need to figure out audio processing stuff, and might be more well documented?). Indecision and lack of drive for ethier. 

### 2024/05/23
Switched to replicating MD5 because we couldn't find great documentation to debugg SSTV. Found resources to help with replciating MD5, we also have a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L5EoYW-sUBFakbkqqNC-GjzaK4cZB_PYZ6wepM9pxTg/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to check that out?
